# Advent of Code 2025

This is my first time working on the advent of code from [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/).
I am a few days late, but hoping to catch back up. 

I will be using GO with only the standard lib. 
I use GO for some of my production web services for its speed and ease of deployment, but still do not feel fully at home with the fundamentals. 

Hoping to feel more at home through these practice problems.
